# Cryptojam

Cryptojam is a small web site where you can solve cryptograms, created for the [10K Apart](https://a-k-apart.com/) contest in 2016.  The challenge was to build a web site for which an initial usable page could be delivered in 10 kilobytes or less.

The database contains over 100 puzzles of varying lengths and difficulties.  The site should be usable without JavaScript, but is much better with it.

Tip: use the left and right arrow buttons to navigate between letter fields.
